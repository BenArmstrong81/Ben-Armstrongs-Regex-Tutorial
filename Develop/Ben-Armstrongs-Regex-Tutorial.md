# Ben Armstrong's Regex Tutorial

Regular Expression, or, more commonly referred to as “Regex” is a powerful tool that is used in many programming languages and text editors that uses a sequence of characters for patter matching and string manipulation.
This Regex Tutorial covers the syntax and basic concepts of Regex, as well as examples of common use cases, tips for writing efficient and effective regular expressions.


## Summary

In this tutorial I will cover off on the following eleven main Regular Expressions (Regex) components; Anchors, Quantifiers, OR Operators, Character Classes, Flags, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket Expressions, Greedy and Lazy Matching, Boundaries, Back-references, and Look-ahead and Look-behind.

An example code for each will be provided along with a brief summary of how/what each is used for. The aim is to provide you with a solid foundation so that you gain an understanding of the most commonly used regex components and how to use them effectively in your own projects. 
I hope you enjoy reading as much as I did creating this for you!
